I can think of 4 ways to handle OTPs (MFA).

Remove OTP requirement for test accounts/test environments

Allow static OTP for test accounts/test environments.

Fetch OTP from DB or using API. There could be security issue here, but team should still try to do this.

Fetch OTP from the real mobile device

Many folks go with option 4, mainly because they don't get required support for 1, 2 and 3. May be because they think it would be simple through the UI. But it is not!

Option 4 is the worst option.

Why?

From the app perspective, all it need is the OTP.

The app doesn't even send the OTP on it's own. It's done by the backend notification service that can be validated using the API.

Now, why it's a bad idea to fetch the OTP from the device. Here're the reasons:

This flow has nothing to do with your app.

This flow tie your test account with your device.

This is not reliable. Prone to frequent failures.

Different implementation needed for iOS and Android. Even for Android, there could be variations in the flow based on the OEM.

So think twice before you go with option 4.
