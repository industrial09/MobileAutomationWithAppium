React native apps can very well be automated with Appium. React native apps are Native apps and not Hybrid apps. The Sauce Lab demo app used in this course is a react native app.

If you are automating a react native app and cannot find UI elements uniquely, then ask your dev to add a "testID" attribute for each UI element. This attribute is mapped to resource-id (or content-desc) in case of Android and AccessibilityIdentifier (or label) in case of iOS.

Dev might be hesitant to add a "accessibilityLabel" attribute because it can create problems with accessibility reader tools.

With "testID", this problem can be avoided.

You can even have both "accessibilityLabel" and "testID" set if your dev agrees on this.

If you get this done, you will not need XPath in most of the cases and your life will become easy. Trust me on this.
